Rackspace API fun
=================

Another PoC / actually this one should work for you, slightly depends what account
you have on Rackspace, this works with the 'basic' account.

If you wanna try just change the values in .env file and run main.py

This script is fairly simple, connects to RS account, pulls your server list, do some mapping
of json (desired values), than converts the result from json to csv.


Why would you do that?

Because than you can process it within Orange and do some data science over your
infrastructure.


I should push this fun as an Orange plugin, but time is real currency, so maybe later, one day.
