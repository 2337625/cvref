Racoon
======

Racoon is IPsec server/gateway which is compatible with Android and Windows and it's easier to set it up than strongswan especially on Android where it has native IPsec support. And sure, you can use standard vpnc (cisco vpn client) to connect to Racoon IPSec server/gateway.

Configuration is not complete and it's only a code sample, and it's already few years old.
